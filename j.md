I spent a lot of time thinking about you and thinking about the Christmas we had together just a year before.

We drove up to grandmas together with Chata in the Subaru. Along the way it caught on fire. I saw smoke as we were driving so I pulled off the highway. I opened the engine bay and saw flames so I rushed to get you and Chata out.

Then we waited for the fire truck for 20 minutes. Then we waited a couple hours for the tow truck. Then we waited for mom to pick us up in King city.

The tow truck driver wouldn't let you in the truck so you had to ride in the car on the back of the rig. You didn't mind but I could see you were somewhat worried.

At grandmas you were my best friend and comfort. It was a rather hard year dealing with everything going on and grandma in her older age. I am guessing she was very stressed out with everything going on.

I was stuck up there for way longer than I was planning as I didn't have a car and I was waiting to hear from the mechanic about what the problem had been. I had also drank A LOT to cope. I remember I was planning on not drinking but I drowned my anxiety and sorrows.

You were there to comfort me. Be a buddy to lay next to. You didn't judge me, just accepted me and stood by my side. You were so caring like always. You wanted to check what was going on in the kitchen but you did a great job staying out of there. I was surprised I didn't have to yell at you to get out like I definitely needed to in the past.

I think about you every single day. I always and will forever miss you. I feel like I am somewhat coping with death better. I got my nose surgery and when I was laying there before I got put under I was wondering what it would be like if this was it - the end of the line.

And you know what, it didn't seem bad. I was scared about not waking up, not that I welcomed it, but just that it wouldn't be so bad. The biggest thing I was worried about was how Mom, Chata, Hilarie, and Edith would feel.

I suppose that is probably similar to how you felt. No pain, surrounded by loved ones. I am sure you're not in a bad place, hopefully a great place. Sometimes I see glimpses of you in others, even in mr. beasley.

It seems like in life when you live you see loved ones die or you die yourself. Today I have been thinking about which one is preferable. To die or watch everyone you love or know die.

Ever since I learned of your cancer is when my spritual has started.
